Customer churn is a common problem faced by businesses across many industries. In the 
telecommunications industry, customer churn can have a significant impact on revenue and profitability. 
Therefore, it is important for telecommunications companies to identify customers who are likely to 
churn and take steps to retain them. This project will use machine learning techniques to build a 
predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to churn.
