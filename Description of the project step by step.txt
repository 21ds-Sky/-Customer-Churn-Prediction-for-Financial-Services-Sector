Importing Libraries: The initial step is to import necessary libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn, which are used for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning tasks.

Loading the Dataset: The dataset "Telco-Customer-Churn.csv" is loaded into a pandas DataFrame named 'df'.

Exploring the Dataset: The code snippet df.info() provides information about the dataset, including the data types and the presence of missing values. df.isnull().sum() checks for missing values in each column.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: In this step, unnecessary columns (like 'customerID') are dropped, and categorical variables are converted into dummy variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding. This prepares the data for machine learning algorithms.

Feature Selection: SelectKBest with chi-square is used for feature selection. It selects the top k features that have the strongest relationship with the target variable.

Splitting the Data: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split from scikit-learn.

Building and Evaluating Logistic Regression Model: Logistic regression is trained on the training data, and predictions are made on the testing data. Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report are used to evaluate the model's performance.

Building and Evaluating Random Forest Model: Similar to logistic regression, a random forest classifier is trained and evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Handling Class Imbalance: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is applied to handle class imbalance by oversampling the minority class (churned customers) in the training set.

Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV is used to tune the hyperparameters of the random forest classifier using cross-validation.

Training the Tuned Model: The random forest classifier is trained again with the best parameters obtained from GridSearchCV.

Final Evaluation: The tuned random forest model is evaluated on the testing data using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
